# Automated-Attendance-System
Face recognition is a big research area which takes more attention of many researchers in computer technology. The human face recognition from video sequences is a challenging task, because there are variations present in the background of the images, facial expression and illumination. Our aim to develop an automated attendance management system which can capture and mark presence of students as well as employees using video frame with deep learning method. This system is able to capture real time video and can generate attendance report with improved accuracy.
